|Not doing|<p>*Ability to view Interviewer‚Äôs stats* </p><p>1. *Unique offering from our end to view which interviewer is performing the best / better* </p><p>2. *We envision to do this by tracking the stats of ‚Äúinterviewer effectiveness‚Äù. This is done by tracking out of how many candidates approved by the interviewer in their taken round - the number of candidates that are able to actually bag an offer. This naturally excludes bar raiser / leadership interviewers, who are generally tasked to take the final round.* </p><p>3. *Via this, we aim to cultivate interviewer collaboration and not competition, implying an adept interviewer could share pointers on what makes them more effective*</p>|
|Acceptance Criteria|<p>1. *HR is able to easily on-board onto Interviewium, with a quick and clear sign up process* </p><p>2. *HRs are able to extend 1-click sign up invitation to interviewers* </p><p>3. *HRs can track all past / upcoming interview rounds* </p><p>4. *Single page solution to extend offer and reject candidates* </p><p>5. *Easily digestible YTD (Year To Date) interview stats view*</p>|
