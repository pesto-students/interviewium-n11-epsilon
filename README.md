Interviews! Around 150 million people go though interview process in a year. Every 1 min 3 people are hired though LinkedIn. Well, managing those interview processes is something what we do at Interviewium :) Interviewium is intended to be used by companies to manage their end-to-end Interview processes and to provide the (often nervous) interviewees a fantastic experience. We have strived to provide all the Personas at Interviewium a seamless experience. Our goal is to create a platform where HR, Interviewer, Interviewee can follow a process driven approach of hiring rather than HR driven. We want to remove the HR hurdles of often managing all interviewee through Excel & the constant going back and forth for deciding timings.

Welcome! We hope you enjoy our application as much as we enjoyed making it.
